        <h2>Handy tips on how to create accessible websites for everyone</h2>
        <img src="./Accessibility.png" alt="" class="center" />
        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
          accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
          designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
          and users). This often comes down to a lack of understanding around
          different user needs. Designing pages that are accessible for everyone
          shouldn't be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have
          collated an 'easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility. Keep
          this guide handyâ€¦ When creating your own websites you can check these
          criteria off the list!

          <h2>Accessibility Checks:</h2>
          <p>
            Elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used to
            represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that
            allow page navigation from heading to heading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text
            resize settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom,
            page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring
            styling issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
            Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate
            alternative text.
          </p>

          <p>
            Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of
            context, and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text
            style from normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page,
            it has been labelled as doing so.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used
            for navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been
            put in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour
            combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have
            also ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off,
            information on the site can still be accessed and read. Forms: forms
            are marked up correctly so people can interact with them using only
            the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form labels
            themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it
            easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks
            of the web right, developers can help create an Internet that works
            for everyone.
